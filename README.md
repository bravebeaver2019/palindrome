# Getting Started

### Running application
Please, run the following command specifying a string argument
```bash
./paindrome 12321
```
### Comments and improvements

* On first attempt I ran across the whole string comparing each element with the mirrored one until I found a difference.

Palindrome.java#10
```java
    for(int i=0; i<length; i++)
```
Palindrome.java
